 In this method, an approximate value is filled in for each diagonal element. Until it converges, the process is iterated. This algorithm was first called the Jacobi transformation process of matrix diagonalization. Jacobi Method is also known as the simultaneous displacement method.
 
Jacobi Iterative Method
The first iterative technique is called the Jacobi method, named after Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi (1804–1851) to solve the system of linear equations. This method makes two assumptions: 

Assumption 1: The given system of equations has a unique solution.
Assumption 2: The coefficient matrix A has no zeros on its main diagonal, namely, a11, a22,…, ann, are non-zeros
